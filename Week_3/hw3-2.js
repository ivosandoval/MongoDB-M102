Now check in a similar manner the "city" field for its first character. You will find there are cities in the collection that start with a number -- which indicates either a noisy data set or zip codes that have no corresponding city. Let's suppose we want to delete these zip code documents -- the ones that have a numeric city name -- from our data set. Do a remove operation to delete those documents.
After removing the documents indicated above, how many documents remain in the zips collection?
